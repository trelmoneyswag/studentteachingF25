            Assessments- Performance Tasks & Historical Inquiry 
        </summary>
        <p>
            I have spent a lot of time this semester thinking about the task of assessing students with a style of teaching that focuses a lot on historical inquiry as the method of learning.  I often talk with my colleagues in the department office about their exams. They often mention how they do a mix of things but that multiple choice quizzes are really quite convenient for them to be able to do all the grading that is required of teachers. I have grappled with this, there is a level of what is manageable for a teacher to be able to meaningfully give feedback on for their students. However, there is also a level of what is meaningful. I do not really buy into a student realizing that they know 75% of the things they were supposed to memorize really is impactful for students. I don’t think that really asks them to learn. At least it doesn’t ask them to engage in history as a discipline. For me in my practice, I want assessments to feel like they are actually meaningful for both my students as learners and for me as a teacher who wants to ensure that students have meaningful learning experiences around historical inquiry. My coop used a lot of Performance Tasks that asked students to really think about their work and their skills as history students that I think I will definitely take inspiration from.

            Communicating about Purpose
        </summary>
        <p>
            One of the most common refrains that I hear from my coop is to emphasize the why of what we’re doing. This has been an intentional skill that I have cultivated throughout my student teaching experience. I have really tried to continue to do this with my new students in the full time position. I try and explain to my students what the discipline of history is and why students are asked to read and write in a specific way. I noticed this worked a lot better with my students during student teaching. I honestly think a big part of this was because I was constantly reflecting on the why of each stage of a lesson with Sophie. This meant that I, myself, was grounded in the why each and every day. I definitely have room for improvement in not feeling absolutely and completely overwhelmed everyday. This would mean that I could really plan for each day and script out what I say. This is something I try and do, but most days it is a little half baked. I need to print! And grade!!!! However, I know it will get easier and that I will be able to communicate the purpose more clearly.

Purpose becomes really important particularly when there are multistage projects happening. This means that students need buy-in to be able to figure out exactly what they should be doing and WHY. I also think that at my high school, Central, it can be tempting to hold grades over students’ heads. “It is important to learn this because it is x% of the grade” or “this will be on the test/ midterm.” THAT IS A TRAP. That doesn’t promote real learning, that promotes fear and a desire to do things completely not with intention. It feels similar to a lecture, the easy way out. Students will do things because they care about the grade and want to do well, but their motivation becomes a number rather than really understanding things. This leads to a desire to rely on cheating, or Artificial Intelligence usage (ugh gross).

            Engaging Students in Learning - Reflecting on Lectures
        </summary>
        <p>
            One thing Mr. P said to me during our one on one for the Social Studies Method workshop was that lectures are the easy way out. They are an easy and convenient way to present information that you know and you know the students need to know. I have been thinking a lot about this throughout my work. It is really so easy to get students to take notes, especially at a place like Central, where the students will do the notes. Students will take notes and they may even remember your information. However, this method often feels like a real way to lean into what Freire refers to as “the banking method”. Lectures imply that the teacher is sort of the keeper of the secret of knowledge. I am really struggling with this in the context of my AP Government and Politics Class. The class has a pretty rigid structure that does not really necessitate that the students think for themselves in meaningful ways. Rather, the curriculum is mostly about students getting the content and memorizing it. There is a lot about the class and the AP structure that necessitates a lecture of some sort. I have started to break this down in a few ways. First, when I go over the “lesson plans” that I get from the other teacher who teaches this course, I try to make sure that there is some level of making lectures “interactive”. I try to ask students what they think of certain things and to have those interactions be meaningful points of learning. I don’t think my new students really have that buy-in to that style of learning. I know that lectures will be an important part of any teaching, but I am really trying to navigate ways to not have them make me want to bang my head against the wall because they are so boring.
