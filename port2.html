            Classroom set up was the first thing that Ms. Date and I tackled the first day of PD. She had a vision for the room and it was the vision that I depicted here. She explained her thought process behind the organization which I thought was helpful to better understand the options for setting up a classroom. She didn’t like just straight rows because she felt like that limited her movement as well as student collaboration. She also mentioned that she has tried having the default be groupings and that didn’t really work, but I can’t really remember why she said that it didn’t work. She landed on this arrangement because she said that it promoted a collaborative space where students were able to work together, but also that they were able all pay attention to the front of the room when she was explaining directions or talking in front of the class. I think that this became apparent when one day we had the students start in groups where some of the desks were angled away from the smart board. I was in charge of leading the classroom and it was definitely harder to do classroom management in that way. It is just tempting to talk to the person you’re looking at rather than turn around and look at a teacher. I think that there are some limitations to this setup. The most prominent being that a few students sitting closest to the windows in the frontmost row have said that they have difficulty seeing the board. One student has moved seats because of this, but there aren’t always better options because most classes have almost all of the seats taken. I think that when we reorganize students seating charts (which we plan to do soon because there is need in other ways) we will plan to avoid students sitting there to make sure the board is accessible. The next is that I find it difficult to check in on students who sit in the back of each section near the rows. I struggle to connect with them and see what work they are doing/ support them during quick walk arounds. I think this may be a personal problem though.

When we were setting up we also put colored tape with numbers on the desks. There are pairs of the same colored tape for pairs of desks around the room. We refer to these as elbow partners and these are the peers that we ask the students to do the turn and talks with. I think that this has been really helpful in avoiding the awkward tension of trying to find a turn and talk buddy. I think that if a teacher didn’t have so much collaboration and built in discussion as a part of the routines of the class that the rows in this way would feel a little awkward and not much better than just straight up rows and columns. However, I think Ms. Date utilizes the space in a good way. The structure also helps us walk around the classroom (with some aforementioned limitations). Additionally, the elbow partners and the ways the class sort of forms a U-shape makes it feel more like a community.

Lastly, the walls don’t have a ton of resources or decoration, but I am excited to see them fill up with student work which I think is pretty cool.

I have really really enjoyed watching Ms. Date set up her classroom. I think that the one thing I have noticed over the first 2 weeks of her setting up her classroom that is REALLY awesome is her gradual approach to expectation set up. Not only does she introduce the syllabus over the course of 2-3 days, she also slowly discusses expectations and her views on the classroom. She discussed on the first day her beliefs for the classroom ( amongst some other expectations): 
<br> 1. I believe that EVERY STUDENT in my classroom CAN SUCCEED.
<br> 2. I believe that EVERY STUDENT  in my classroom is RESPONSIBLE for their OWN LEARNING.
<br> 3. I believe that EVERY STUDENT in my classroom is RESPONSIBLE for the LEARNING of OTHERS
<br> <br> Then on the second day, she has the class create classroom agreements together (and she goes over work and homework expectations). Throughout the first week, she did some really interesting stuff by way of setting norms and expectations that were less structured into the actual content of the days’ plans. First, she made sure to say to affirm that students bring a lot to the class and the school. She said in every class during a little speech about the school and class: “you are a gift to Central”. I think that affirmation is something that will go a long way. On the third day, when we started to get into class discussion she made sure to tell each class that she asks people to “move up and move up” (aka move up into a listening role or move up into a speaking role). This is in opposition to step up step back which puts speaking at a higher level than listening. I really liked this framing and she refers back to it on almost a daily basis. She also scaffolds note taking for the freshmen and the reading skills for the freshmen and juniors. I think that these content based skills are also super helpful. 
Ms. Date helps to build community AND scaffold classroom participation by asking students to turn and talk a lot. I notice that she does this a lot more in the freshmen class than she does in the junior IB class. I talked to her about this and she is pretty intentional about scaffolding participation more with the younger students and frames every discussion as an activity to be planned and scaffolded which I really appreciate. 
I think it has been hard for me to really understand how the school operates in a bigger picture because the school is so big and it doesn’t feel like I can really tell the culture yet. Or maybe I just need to look harder to find it.

The activities that we are doing in class are also oriented around building community which I think is pretty cool.
