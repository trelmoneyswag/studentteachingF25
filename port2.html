Classroom Observations

        <h2>
            Observe two-three times a day in your cooperating teacher's classes, particularly in the first classes you will ultimately take over. -

I observed my teacher teach the 3rd, 4th, and 7th period World History classes. I started taking over the 7th period pretty quickly into the semester, so I started paying more attention to the 7th period and the way that Ms. Date interacts with that class. I really like the way Ms. Date teaches and runs her classroom. Some of the first things I noticed were the ways she commands the classroom. She often doesn’t have to do gimmicks or speak more than once to get a students’ attention. She is really engaged and engaging in the front of the classroom. This is partially her energy and also the ways that her lesson plans are really scaffolded so that students are really encouraged to participate, but that looks like really different things in different ways. One of the most common tools that Ms. Date utilizes is the “turn and talk”. I think that this really works for students in this context. A lot of the students in these classes are very nervous about academic performance (I can tell this based on their dispositions as well as their origin story projects). I think these turn and talks help the students both stay engaged as well as start to think through their answers so that they are more prepared to share with the whole class. Ms. Date works through content really intentionally and in such a way that makes it obvious that she is making sure that every student is confident in the material before moving on. The students in seventh period are really interesting, a good mix of kids who are pretty quiet, but a lot of them are really interested in sharing and having their voice heard in class.

For this task I went to an Art II class taught by Ms. Keefe. Art II is an elective that students opt into so there was a range of 10th through 12th grade students. I walked in on a day where students were being tasked with decorating their sketchbooks. The teacher has the room organized with tables of 4 where students are facing each other. When the class started she put the daily objectives on the board (which was to continue working on the sketchbook cover). She also spent some time talking about the Google Classroom set up (it was the 2nd week of school and there were some newer students in the class). She also gave students an example and referenced the scaffolded assignment (personal symbols) to help support students in coming up with ideas. Then the students just worked. I walked around this block and had time to chat with students about the class and what they were working on. I think Art class is a tricky class to observe because I truly have no idea how I would teach it and also I haven’t taken an art class in 10 years. I think that because of that I felt a little out of my depth in knowing expectations for the class. 
It became quickly clear that there were a lot of different access points to the class for students. Some students seemed incredibly disinterested in the prospect of drawing even something that was supposed to be personal and exciting. Some students felt really stressed by their “lack of artistic ability”. Other students confidently got to work. I think that this being an elective makes it really interesting because no one HAS to be there and students have a wide array of reasons for taking the class. This means the teacher was going around and giving a lot of really different feedback to try and meet students where they are at.

<h2>Shadow one student in your class for a class or two outside of the one they have with you.</h2>

<p>I shadowed a student, H, for two classes on Tuesday September 16. I went to his Chinese and English classes. I don’t really know why I picked H besides the fact that he sits in the front of the class and is very eager and often has a lot of questions. I think that he exhibits a little bit of anxiety that is evident through these questions and his approach to learning in the World History classroom. The first class that I observed H in was his introductory Chinese class. The first thing that I noticed was that he had his binder out before the bell had rung, one of a few students to do this. The teacher started the class by asking students to repeat something back to him (in Chinese). I noticed that H was engaged in both this and the “bell work”- which required students to copy down Chinese characters. The first half of the class was really notes and lecture based, which the student was doing diligently. The second half of the class was a student to student interaction. This was where I really saw the most of H’s personality as a learner. They were being asked to ask each other questions and respond in Chinese. H really struggled with the directions and kept referring back to notes before speaking. He seemed really anxious about saying something wrong. I think that H represents a way of learning that is really focused on the right answer rather than productive struggle. I noticed this in the English class that I observed as well. They were tasked with writing a poem. H really struggled with coming up with something that he felt met the rubric expectations. Overall, I learned a lot about H as a learner in the classroom. I think that World History will be a great place for him to explore productive struggle. We have already started to push him with the Unit 1 Performance Task- where the question is “What does it mean to be human?”. One thing I want to continue to do to support him is to ask him questions that make him feel confident in his own work and learning process rather than relying on the validation of me as his teacher.

            Classroom set up was the first thing that Ms. Date and I tackled the first day of PD. She had a vision for the room and it was the vision that I depicted here. She explained her thought process behind the organization which I thought was helpful to better understand the options for setting up a classroom. She didn’t like just straight rows because she felt like that limited her movement as well as student collaboration. She also mentioned that she has tried having the default be groupings and that didn’t really work, but I can’t really remember why she said that it didn’t work. She landed on this arrangement because she said that it promoted a collaborative space where students were able to work together, but also that they were able all pay attention to the front of the room when she was explaining directions or talking in front of the class. I think that this became apparent when one day we had the students start in groups where some of the desks were angled away from the smart board. I was in charge of leading the classroom and it was definitely harder to do classroom management in that way. It is just tempting to talk to the person you’re looking at rather than turn around and look at a teacher. I think that there are some limitations to this setup. The most prominent being that a few students sitting closest to the windows in the frontmost row have said that they have difficulty seeing the board. One student has moved seats because of this, but there aren’t always better options because most classes have almost all of the seats taken. I think that when we reorganize students seating charts (which we plan to do soon because there is need in other ways) we will plan to avoid students sitting there to make sure the board is accessible. The next is that I find it difficult to check in on students who sit in the back of each section near the rows. I struggle to connect with them and see what work they are doing/ support them during quick walk arounds. I think this may be a personal problem though. 
<br>
<br>
When we were setting up we also put colored tape with numbers on the desks. There are pairs of the same colored tape for pairs of desks around the room. We refer to these as elbow partners and these are the peers that we ask the students to do the turn and talks with. I think that this has been really helpful in avoiding the awkward tension of trying to find a turn and talk buddy. I think that if a teacher didn’t have so much collaboration and built in discussion as a part of the routines of the class that the rows in this way would feel a little awkward and not much better than just straight up rows and columns. However, I think Ms. Date utilizes the space in a good way. The structure also helps us walk around the classroom (with some aforementioned limitations). Additionally, the elbow partners and the ways the class sort of forms a U-shape makes it feel more like a community.

Lastly, the walls don’t have a ton of resources or decoration, but I am excited to see them fill up with student work which I think is pretty cool.

I have really really enjoyed watching Ms. Date set up her classroom. I think that the one thing I have noticed over the first 2 weeks of her setting up her classroom that is REALLY awesome is her gradual approach to expectation set up. Not only does she introduce the syllabus over the course of 2-3 days, she also slowly discusses expectations and her views on the classroom. She discussed on the first day her beliefs for the classroom ( amongst some other expectations): 
<br> 1. I believe that EVERY STUDENT in my classroom CAN SUCCEED.
<br> 2. I believe that EVERY STUDENT  in my classroom is RESPONSIBLE for their OWN LEARNING.
<br> 3. I believe that EVERY STUDENT in my classroom is RESPONSIBLE for the LEARNING of OTHERS
<br> <br> Then on the second day, she has the class create classroom agreements together (and she goes over work and homework expectations). Throughout the first week, she did some really interesting stuff by way of setting norms and expectations that were less structured into the actual content of the days’ plans. First, she made sure to say to affirm that students bring a lot to the class and the school. She said in every class during a little speech about the school and class: “you are a gift to Central”. I think that affirmation is something that will go a long way. On the third day, when we started to get into class discussion she made sure to tell each class that she asks people to “move up and move up” (aka move up into a listening role or move up into a speaking role). This is in opposition to step up step back which puts speaking at a higher level than listening. I really liked this framing and she refers back to it on almost a daily basis. She also scaffolds note taking for the freshmen and the reading skills for the freshmen and juniors. I think that these content based skills are also super helpful. 
Ms. Date helps to build community AND scaffold classroom participation by asking students to turn and talk a lot. I notice that she does this a lot more in the freshmen class than she does in the junior IB class. I talked to her about this and she is pretty intentional about scaffolding participation more with the younger students and frames every discussion as an activity to be planned and scaffolded which I really appreciate. 
I think it has been hard for me to really understand how the school operates in a bigger picture because the school is so big and it doesn’t feel like I can really tell the culture yet. Or maybe I just need to look harder to find it.
<br> <br>
The activities that we are doing in class are also oriented around building community which I think is pretty cool. For example, the first big assignment that we did was an Origin Story Project which asked students to describe their own origin story
