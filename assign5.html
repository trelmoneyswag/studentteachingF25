    <p> Assignment 5</p>

    <p>
        I mapped out the first four weeks of student teaching based on my teacherâ€™s pretty thorough curriculum map from the 2024-2025 school year. She shared this with me when we met in May and then we discussed it more in depth when we met up in late July. I took the map of the first month of her curriculum from last year and highlighted the parts in red that I think will be content knowledge gaps. 
<br>
<br>The first two weeks are pretty oriented around getting students familiar with history as a field and also with their community. The project for that time is called the origin story project. Ms. Date sent me the assignment for the origin story project and told me that it would be great if I could do an example of my own origin story. I am planning on doing this project which will definitely help me think about how to support students through this project. There is less content the first two weeks and the content that exists is really up my alley. I love to think critically about history and I have resources from history classes and my thesis that will help me think about them. 
<br>
<br>For the content that I highlighted in red (which there certainly is more than I would have hoped), I talked to Ms. Date and she sent me a lot of the resources that she pulls from to create her lessons and I think my plan is to spend a lot of time exploring those resources to make sure I feel at least a little knowledgeable about the topics that we will cover in the first few weeks.
