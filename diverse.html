            Parent Narrative
        </summary>
        <p>

I is a student who comes to class most days really ready to learn. She has exhibited excitement about both content, but also simply about the process of learning in general. I am just getting to know I in this new classroom assignment, but I believe that she is going to be a valuable class contributor and thought partner to the people around her. I have already seen this in how she engages with even small partner work. I often structure my class with many “turn and talks” where I ask students to think through content together with a partner before being asked to share to a class or write something down. I engages really thoughtfully with her partner and I can tell she is really grappling with the questions I am asking the students to think through.

I also worked diligently with regards to the work that had already been assigned in this class. For a few weeks there was a temporary sub in the classroom that the students had to self motivate through assignments. I seemed to really take on that challenge successfully and was able to use that time effectively, not an easy task. I am really looking forward to seeing how else I adapts to a history classroom that is less content acquisition based and more skills based. I hope that I continues to develop confidence in her skills and trust in her ability to perform well in class.

            Reflection on Queerness
        </summary>
        <p>
            A friend once asked me if my students knew I was gay because she didn’t know if her queerness should be present in the classroom. I honestly got a little upset at this question. I don’t tell students anything about my sexuality, but I introduce myself as Mr. Trelstad and I say I use they/them pronouns. This is just a different way to be a queer teacher. I cannot hide this part of me and still feel respected and myself in the classroom. Obviously, I don’t think teachers should hide their queerness in any way to young people. However, I simply do not really have that choice. I cannot hide. And that feels really scary. I try not to think about the prospect of dealing with a transphobic parent or, god forbid, a student. I try not to let my fear overwhelm me as I try my best to be a present and good teacher. However, sometimes I wake up and I put on my clothes and I wonder about how my transness is perceived by my students and whether I am being safe by using they/them pronouns in a school and presenting the way that I do. It is a little debilitating. I live in a constant fear of doing the wrong thing or saying something that would put myself in a bad situation. How can I be my authentic self while not asserting myself too much as to draw attention or upset the wrong people???? (the other ap gov teacher uses the wrong pronouns for me literally every day and I gave up on correcting him because of this fear) 
<br> <br>
However, every once in a while I am reminded of the importance of being a queer person working with young people. This is because I sometimes forget that there are young people (much like I was less than a decade ago) who really need someone like me to be there for them. And I don’t even need to be anything in particular, I just literally need to exist. I need to be there and be unafraid in my queerness (I am so afraid). I know that this has an immediate impact because my nonbinary student in my student teaching placement expressed to me an immediate trust and willingness to ask questions (some I couldn’t answer). But the fact that they asked me shows that having representation matters. Another student in my real full time teaching position came out to me via google form because I put a Queer Joy is Sacred art piece I created on my intro slide. I didn’t even know how to respond to that so I didn’t. I didn’t want to make the student uncomfortable and maybe that was a mistake. I am trying to figure out how to be brave for my students and how to show up every day to be myself and to lead with joy. I feel mournful everyday for the queer youth who don’t have support and I think to myself, if nothing else. I am showing up and showing students that queer adulthood is possible and real and right in front of them, but damn is it hard.
