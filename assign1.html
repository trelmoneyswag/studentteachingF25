    <p> Assignment 1</p>

    <p>
        Central High School is one of the oldest public schools in the country. It is also a magnet school which in the Philadelphia School District means that students apply to the school during the 8th grade as opposed to the catchment system which places students in schools based on their home address. I researched a lot about the magnet application process because I find it very interesting (particularly the recent changes) and also the structure of Central as a magnet school determines its student body and the students I will be working with. 
<br>
The district made a pretty drastic shift in October 2021 around magnet school admissions. Instead of school leadership making decisions about admitting students into the school, now students are admitted based on a lottery system where students from underrepresented zip codes are given priority. Central and another school, Masterman, have the highest standards for applying. Students looking to apply must have all As and Bs, must be in the 80th percentile of both ELA and Math PSSA (or other standardized test), and have 95% attendance during the previous school year. The lottery system has apparently increased the number of Black and Latino students into the magnet schools (although, I haven’t seen articles about Central specifically).
<br> Despite a change in admissions process, Great Schools shows the student demographics as being 35% Asian, 28% white, 22% Black, and 10% Hispanic, which is far from representative of Philly’s racial demographics. Great Schools also states that 100% of students are low-income, but Philadelphia provides lunches to all students and so the fact that Great Schools uses that as a metric is not very helpful. 
<br> I met up with my Cooperating Teacher, Ms. Date, and also talked to some CITs that I worked with this summer about the atmosphere at Central. Everyone I talked to seemed to really enjoy Central, but also mentioned that it was a place that facilitated stress of the students. The students who I talked to who were rising seniors seemed quite stressed with college applications, but spoke highly of the school and the way it has taught them. I am a little wary because the students I spoke with and Ms. Date are all white. I anticipate there being differing experiences for the students of color at the school, particularly Black and Brown students. Central is in the Logan section of Philadelphia, but, as mentioned, the demographics don’t represent the geographic neighborhood or the Philadelphia ones either. I know that Ms. Date works with the Bridge program which helps support the transition for incoming students who may not have the same resources as others to make sure that they can thrive. I am really glad that this exists and that my teacher is a part of making it happen and I hope to become involved. However, the need for its existence (it was started in 2020) implies to me that there is certainly a lack of institutional support and/or barriers to success for Black and Brown students. I think having students who are entirely new to the school environment will pose a challenge to me because I don’t necessarily have the ability to help them facilitate the school as easily as if I were a full time teacher. 
<br> Overall, I am very excited to be working at Central and being able to engage with ninth graders in World History. I view the diversity of Central as a benefit to the development of my skills as a teacher. Reflecting on the questions in Unearthing Joy, I hope to do a good job of bringing my identity into the classroom. I want to be able to be a strong queer role model for young people, and also I want to support young people, particularly the white and class privileged students in reflecting on their privilege. I wasn’t sure I would be in a school that would ask that of me, but now that I am I feel excited about taking on that challenge, as well as supporting all students to see their identity in the curriculum and feel joy in the classroom.
