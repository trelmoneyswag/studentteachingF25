            This was not my first read through of Unearthing Joy by Gholdy Muhammad, but it was certainly my most thorough. I really appreciate this book and the framework of adding the fifth pursuit of joy to the learning pursuits of Culturally and Historically Responsive Education (CHRE). I think that there are big definitions that will frame how I think about teaching. There were also smaller points, like the presence of guilt (particularly in teaching white children about the past), that made me really think critically about how I want to orient myself to teaching this semester and beyond. I don’t have a ton of actual big curriculum mapping to do in this semester because my cooperating teacher has a really solid plan already, but I definitely think there will be plenty of room for me to explore these five pursuits and work on implementing them. Also, as I was reading this I found myself saying out loud, “Thank gosh I’m teaching social studies.” I am so excited about incorporating things like curriculum as storytelling and getting students to view themselves as historians and to develop those skills with joy.

However, on this read, particularly given the imminent nature of student teaching, I found myself struggling with some parts of this book. Mostly, I am really worried about the actual practical application of some of these practices. For example, one of the first unit examples they gave in the text was about sugar consumption and health concerns. I found the criticality questions really misaligned with what I was assuming criticality would be about. I think that her later examples were a little bit more aligned, but I still feel a little discouraged by this deep read. I feel this mostly because as I start to think about my reality as a full-time teacher, I start to want concrete solutions to the problems I anticipate and goals I want to work for. I just don’ t think that Unearthing Joy felt like it was everything I needed it to be, which is probably an unreal expectation of any book. So despite some of my problems with the ways Muhammad offers practical groundings, I am still very glad to have read this book.
