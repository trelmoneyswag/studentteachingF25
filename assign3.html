            This was not my first read through of Unearthing Joy by Gholdy Muhammad, but it was certainly my most thorough. I really appreciate this book and the framework of adding the fifth pursuit of joy to the learning pursuits of Culturally and Historically Responsive Education (CHRE). I think that there are big definitions that will frame how I think about teaching. There were also smaller points, like the presence of guilt (particularly in teaching white children about the past), that made me really think critically about how I want to orient myself to teaching this semester and beyond. I don’t have a ton of actual big curriculum mapping to do in this semester because my cooperating teacher has a really solid plan already, but I definitely think there will be plenty of room for me to explore these five pursuits and work on implementing them. Also, as I was reading this I found myself saying out loud, “Thank gosh I’m teaching social studies.” I am so excited about incorporating things like curriculum as storytelling and getting students to view themselves as historians and to develop those skills with joy.

However, on this read, particularly given the imminent nature of student teaching, I found myself struggling with some parts of this book. Mostly, I am really worried about the actual practical application of some of these practices. For example, one of the first unit examples they gave in the text was about sugar consumption and health concerns. I found the criticality questions really misaligned with what I was assuming criticality would be about. I think that her later examples were a little bit more aligned, but I still feel a little discouraged by this deep read. I feel this mostly because as I start to think about my reality as a full-time teacher, I start to want concrete solutions to the problems I anticipate and goals I want to work for. I just don’ t think that Unearthing Joy felt like it was everything I needed it to be, which is probably an unreal expectation of any book. So despite some of my problems with the ways Muhammad offers practical groundings, I am still very glad to have read this book.

           Big Takeaways/ Reflection
        </summary>
        <p>
            I really really appreciated this book because it felt so grounding in the ways that I can be and the things that I can say to help create a good classroom space. 
	<br>This book reminded me of all the ways that my attitude will trickle down to the students that I am working with. It is important to maintain calm and respectful while firm to misbehaviors, and to be excited about the academic content.
	<br>I think that my teacher (based on her curriculum last year) has a really good way to build in a lot of what the Responsive Classroom book describes. The origin story project seems to do a good job of allowing for time for meaningful student to student and student to teacher interaction. It does this while also creating expectations for what an academic assignment looks like in the classroom. 
	<br>I have a couple of questions about the book, mostly about how to apply these learnings to high school. I think that some of the brain breaks are really great for middle school, but might play out really differently in high school settings. I was also wondering about the logical consequences section and how to make sure that when a logical consequence is a loss of privilege, the privilege is truly a privilege and not something a student has a right too. 
	<br>Overall, big takeaways: 
<br>-	Importance of community 
<br>-	Understanding where young adolescence are in their life and how to support them
<br>-   Getting to know students
<br>-	Create expectations that center community rather than teacher
<br>-	Build academic content
<br>-	Believe in students and communicate hope!!
