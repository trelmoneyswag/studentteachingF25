            Roleplaying / Simulations
        </summary>
        <p>
            During this seminar I had the opportunity to have a 1:1 conversation with Nick Palazzolo who is a Social Studies teacher at Central High School. I thought this conversation was really fruitful because he introduced me to some really helpful ways for thinking about teaching history. One example he gave was of simulations. I had been really hesitant to engage in any form of roleplaying or adjacent because I really disliked the way that they were framed in the Social Studies and social justice book that I read for the summer reading. That book framed roleplaying as a good way for students to understand oppression, which I guess is a compelling argument. However, I don’t think it makes a ton of sense to have students actually role play oppression. This creates a fake world where some students are oppressed and others are doing the oppression. I am not sure this is ever really developmentally appropriate because students generally need more guardrails than this. I also think it is very useful if you are in a classroom with students who experience oppression in their lives, I think it sort of makes a game out of their real life experiences. I would have pretty flatly rejected any sort of historical simulation because of that perspective. However, Nick really opened my eyes to the ways that simulations could really be productive in the context of movements and making decisions about certain things.
<br>
He showed me his method for developing a simulation in the context of the queer liberation movement. Instead of the question being about oppression. The students take on the role of an organizer in a queer liberation organization and then are faced with a dilemma. The dilemma is something that the organizers really faced and they read perspectives and historical documents to come up with a perspective that they argue in the context of the liberation movement/ specific organization. I think the way that he framed this was really helpful. Doing a simulation gives students a new access point to content while also giving them space for their own input and interpretation of what historical actors should have done. I am considering how to put this learning tool into practice within my World History and maybe even AP Gov classes.

            History Teaching Toolbox
        </summary>

        <p>
            As I transitioned to my own classes, my wonderful wonderful coop teacher - Sophie, gave me the book A History Teaching Toolbox by Russel Tarr. This book is literally over 150 ideas for classroom strategies particularly around history content. I often find myself as I have switched into having my own classroom that I have to teach all by myself (crazy) going to this book for ideas. I hope to one day annotate the book with a few more of my ideas myself. One thing I have learned about teaching history is that I really don’t know everything about history. I actually do not know much at all. Bummer! I don’t think that this makes me a bad teacher. I think that this just means I have to really do the work of the problem posing method. I think my lack of robust facts about history allows for me to do the work that I believe is actually way more interesting and helpful to students. We get to think through problems together and come to conclusions about history that don’t just involve me sort of lecturing about what is fact and what is not. This book is really helpful for creating meaningful engagement points throughout a history curriculum. It even has a section about interpretation and judgement where it allows students to think through the historical questions that are being asked. 
<br>
<br>I love to say to my students that history isn’t always about easy answers and I think that this book reminds me that there are so many different ways to engage students in the complicated work of history.

                Geography
        </summary>
        <p>

I really appreciated the special methods workshop we had about geography because I realized pretty quickly this year that a lot of my freshmen don’t really know about geography, even pretty basic facts, like where New Jersey is. That was a little concerning!! As I started the global connections with my students, I realized I wanted to spend a few more days on just doing geography. Some of this has looked like literally just playing geoguesser as a class. This has been a fun and engaging way to get students to start thinking about all that they don’t know about where things are in the world. I am beginning to really struggle though to make geography interesting and apply some of the lessons that Jodi talked to us and scaffold them up to a 9th grade level for my students. I am starting to think about geography and the creation of maps as something that can tell a story for my students. I had them do a fun activity where students would get a map that was created centuries ago and try to interpret what was happening in the map and what it was useful for. The students were engaged and had really creative answers. They were a little mind blown when I showed them upside down maps and maps that told temporal distance rather than spatial. I hope to impart on my students that geography can be really cool and interesting and a cool field of study.  I have big plans to make geography really interesting because I think there’s so much potential and I actually don’t totally understand the discipline that much enough to scaffold it down to students. The resources that Jodi provided us were really helpful to me in thinking through the standards and also understanding that geography is a tool that can help us understand human history. I think that the geography often gets really boiled down to maps and nothing else. I really want to make learning interesting in all of the ways, and I truly believe that engaging in geographic storytelling can be really important for getting students interested in content.
