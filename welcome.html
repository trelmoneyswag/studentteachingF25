        Hello!
    </p>
    <p>
        Welcome to my student teaching portfolio. I student taught at Central High School, 9th grade World History and currently am a 
        long term sub at Central working with 9th Grade World History and 12th grade AP US Government and Politics. Thank you for coming 
        to my page, I made it myself using my pretty rudimentary coding skills, so feel free to message me with questions, comments, or concerns 
        about usability, or User interface.
