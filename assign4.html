            The five tenets (Inspiring Wonder, Painting a Picture, Application, Connecting the Past to the Present, and Facilitating Change) of this book provided a really helpful framework for me to think about the ways that I want to structure units and my classroom/ lessons broadly. It was helpful to read about examples of ways that each of these tenets could be incorporated into the classroom. However, I found a decent amount of this book kind of irrelevant because either the suggestions were not aligned with my age range, vision, or needs as a high school teacher. I also think that some of the suggestions were not as productive as they claim to be. Mostly the arcs where teachers asked young people to simulate discrimination or oppression. I think that those can be interesting and maybe build empathy. However, I do not think it is worth the trauma that they can inflict on the marginalized students in the classroom. That is something I felt was missing from the book, broadly as well. I think that the considerations of the different ways that students access information and content about oppression is far from universal, and I get wanting to build empathy for all human beings, but I think that you need to prioritize the marginalized students in the classroom. Particularly, if the other option is to “see the humanity” in past’s oppressors.

<br>Overall, this book with its focus on younger grades, and somewhat weird suggestions for activities was not super exciting to me. However, the framework I think has a lot of value in it and I will certainly be thinking about that in my teaching practices.
