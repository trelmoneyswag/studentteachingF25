On 10/11, I went to the PEFP teach-in on global solidarity. It was really interesting to be in a space with other educators that are thinking about how to plan lessons in ways that incorporate Gholdy Muhammad’s pursuit of criticality. I hope that the people I met at this event and that are a part of this group of educators will continue to be helpful for me in thinking about how to be an effective teacher in that realm. It is something that I really want to build up as a skill in the classroom.
<br>
I attended two of the micro teach ins. One was about Sudan and the other was about Latin America. While both were very informative, I found it difficult to see exactly how I would apply this knowledge to the classroom. I found the conversations I had both formally and informally with the fellow teachers, the most generative. It felt really important to see how other teachers are engaging critically with material and pedagogy. It was also a little demoralizing to hear about all the ways that teachers are not supported in these efforts, or are actively discouraged from doing anything really critical in their practice. However, it was nice to see that teachers are really invested in pursuing social justice in their classrooms and schools. 
<br>
The teach-in had a lot of unstructured time in the second half of the day and as I was reflecting during that, I was reminded of one of the main reasons I am interested in pursuing a lifetime career as a teacher. I want to do this work because I really care about incorporating social justice and student power into the classroom. I think a big part of that work is being in community with other educators who are dedicated to the work and a constant effort to keep learning and unlearning.
