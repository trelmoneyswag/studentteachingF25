            Knowing and valuing students 
        </summary>
        <p>
            I think it is very important to make your students feel known in your classroom. I had a student the other day express to me that he was shocked I remembered his name to write him a pass. I felt really sad at that moment because it was hard to believe that a student in his senior year would be shocked that I would remember his name. I take a really intentional approach to learning students' names. I walk around and quiz myself literally every day for the first week of school in order to make sure that I never forget a student’s name. I luckily don’t really struggle with names. However, that feels like the bare minimum. Names are important, but I really want to be able to know my students, but only 50 minutes a day provides real barriers. I have started sort of picking a kid to chat with as they walk in which allows a little bit of an opportunity to chat. I also tried to incorporate getting to know students as a part of early assignments. In Ms. Date’s class, this looked like the origin story projects. In my class, that looked like the build your own major world religion project. This allows students to show some of their personality which is just super exciting. I love when students can tell me who they are!!!!

I also think I have a lot of growing to do in supporting students through hard times. In all honesty, I can be a little bit awkward as a human. This means that when students come to me with a dilemma that is affecting their work (which doesn’t happen often) or when I need to approach a student because I can tell their struggling, I often feel really inadequate in what I am able to say. I think that this will just come with practice but goddamn it is hard to figure out exactly what to say and how to be supportive but also a teacher. I want to be good!!
