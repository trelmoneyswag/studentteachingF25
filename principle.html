        <p>
            This video was taken during my Long Term Sub position with my second period World History class which is 9th graders. It was taken in later November, a couple weeks into my takeover of this class. This was an interesting lesson to choose to record because it was the first time I was really bringing in how I want to teach history class to these students, which is through Historical Inquiry. The day before this I had given a lecture about the Inca Empire in Tawantinsuyu where students were asked to take guided notes along with the lecture. 	The goal for this day of instruction was to walk students through the process of annotating historical documents. It is a pretty fundamental skill that is needed for this class and for history in general.
<br><br>
I think I did a good job in the beginning of the class of previewing the day and the next week. It is important to get buy-in from students around what we’re doing and why. One thing I’m really working on with this new set of students is bringing really good energy to doing history and just the class in general. I think that Sophie brought a lot of really good energy to history class and the classroom, and I think I relied on that when I was teaching with her in the room. Something I noticed in this video was that my excitement was not really where it could be. I think I really thrived on getting students excited about history and it didn’t often feel like I was pulling teeth to get students to engage in the work. I think part of that is just a result of not having the students from the beginning of the year. It also is definitely because I am still working through my classroom management styles.
<br><br>As you can see in the video, the students are compliant and listening. They take notes when told to take notes and are following along. I would say that I can see learning happening in this way. I think I do a good job of saying things like “a successful annotation looks like” and then modeling exactly what the expectations are. I think this creates a sense of clear expectations and ways to build skills so that everyone is on the same page. 
<br><br>One thing I am concerned about in this class is my speed and timing. I don’t think it was necessarily too fast for the majority of students, but I noticed that when I graded these students' annotations that some students wrote everything down that I had said as I was explaining. Some of the students, however, barely had anything written down. I wonder how I can make sure that I am exciting, engaging, and also just commanding enough that students feel more accountable for their annotations. I also wonder if I can move at a different pace, or change the way I deliver these notes. I think that I do a good job of repeating myself enough, but I wonder if there can be a way I can make this more engaging. 
<br><br>I think when I asked students to pull out their notes, I should have asked them to have their notes on their desk before. I also need to make that expectation of bringing their notes everyday an expectation that is clear, because they are young!! I also think that the conversation around the difference between the textbook and my lecture could have been a lot more fruitful. 
<br><br>When I was reading the text, I think I did not project and have a commanding presence in my actual inflection. I think that I could be a little better in this way. I think there are many subtle ways that I can improve on my lecture and modeling which this video really illuminates for me. I also need to enunciate more….

        Central High School:
<br><br>
Central High School is one of the oldest public schools in the country. It is also a magnet school which in the Philadelphia School District means that students apply to the school during the 8th grade as opposed to the catchment system which places students in schools based on their home address. I researched a lot about the magnet application process because I find it very interesting (particularly the recent changes) and also the structure of Central as a magnet school determines its student body and the students I will be working with. 
<br><br>The district made a pretty drastic shift in October 2021 around magnet school admissions. Instead of school leadership making decisions about admitting students into the school, now students are admitted based on a lottery system where students from underrepresented zip codes are given priority. Central and another school, Masterman, have the highest standards for applying. Students looking to apply must have all As and Bs, must be in the 80th percentile of both ELA and Math PSSA (or other standardized test), and have 95% attendance during the previous school year. The lottery system has apparently increased the number of Black and Latino students into the magnet schools (although, I haven’t seen articles about Central specifically).
<br><br>Despite a change in admissions process, Great Schools shows the student demographics as being 35% Asian, 28% white, 22% Black, and 10% Hispanic, which is far from representative of Philly’s racial demographics. Great Schools also states that 100% of students are low-income, but Philadelphia provides lunches to all students and so the fact that Great Schools uses that as a metric is not very helpful. 
<br><br>I met up with my Cooperating Teacher, Ms. Date, and also talked to some CITs that I worked with this summer about the atmosphere at Central. Everyone I talked to seemed to really enjoy Central, but also mentioned that it was a place that facilitated stress of the students. The students who I talked to who were rising seniors seemed quite stressed with college applications, but spoke highly of the school and the way it has taught them. I am a little wary because the students I spoke with and Ms. Date are all white. I anticipate there being differing experiences for the students of color at the school, particularly Black and Brown students. Central is in the Logan section of Philadelphia, but, as mentioned, the demographics don’t represent the geographic neighborhood or the Philadelphia ones either. I know that Ms. Date works with the Bridge program which helps support the transition for incoming students who may not have the same resources as others to make sure that they can thrive. I am really glad that this exists and that my teacher is a part of making it happen and I hope to become involved. However, the need for its existence (it was started in 2020) implies to me that there is certainly a lack of institutional support and/or barriers to success for Black and Brown students. I think having students who are entirely new to the school environment will pose a challenge to me because I don’t necessarily have the ability to help them facilitate the school as easily as if I were a full time teacher. 
<br><br>Overall, I am very excited to be working at Central and being able to engage with ninth graders in World History. I view the diversity of Central as a benefit to the development of my skills as a teacher. Reflecting on the questions in Unearthing Joy, I hope to do a good job of bringing my identity into the classroom. I want to be able to be a strong queer role model for young people, and also I want to support young people, particularly the white and class privileged students in reflecting on their privilege. I wasn’t sure I would be in a school that would ask that of me, but now that I am I feel excited about taking on that challenge, as well as supporting all students to see their identity in the curriculum and feel joy in the classroom.
