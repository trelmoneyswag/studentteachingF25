            Building an Academic Community Revisited
        </summary>

        <p>

<br><br>
I read the Building Academic Community from Responsive Classrooms book over the summer and it was helpful for me to think about what to notice as my teacher was setting up the classroom and how I could better understand this process. However, I am returning to it now as I begin to think about my transition to solo lead teacher of a new classroom in the middle of the first semester of the school year. 
	<br>I am coming into two World History Classrooms as a long term substitute. Additionally, from what I can tell I also have a pretty different teaching style than the previous teacher of this classroom. It feels really important for me to be able to set my routines and expectations clearly from the beginning so that students can feel comfortable with me. I also am taking over an AP Government section that I am worried about as well because there seems to be little established routines or norms in that class. This makes it really hard for me to come in as a teacher who loves expectations and norms at least in a bare minimum. 
	<br>I plan to pull from this book to think about how to set up my expectations and to make sure that students feel like they can be learners in the classroom. The book also talked about the importance of getting to know your students. I will have the students fill out a google form about themselves which will help me hopefully get to know them a little better. I also intend to spend the first few days building group expectations and expectations for what I want in a classroom and how I intend to teach. For this I have had to think really hard about what I want to explain as my expectations for this class that I present on the slide. It feels like it would maybe be easy, but thinking how to be concise and clear while also making sure it is honest to how I want to facilitate learning in my classroom. 
<br>
I landed on My Teaching Beliefs:<br>
Every student can succeed in this class<br>
Every student brings unique contributions to this class<br>
Learning happens together<br>
<br>
My Expectations:<br>
You are responsible for your learning & the learning of others<br>
Come to class ready to learn<br>
Advocate for yourself<br>
<br>
I honestly don’t know if this is the right move but we shall see!

Reflection on this process  (12/10)
<br>
I thought I did a fine job the first few days/ weekish of school. I’m revisiting this entry because I think it is coming to be really important to me in my freshmen classrooms. I am noticing that some students haven’t really bought into the idea that learning happens together and that it happens in the classroom. I had a chat recently about students’ apathy to my asks for learning in the classroom. When I ask them to turn and talk in the classroom, only a little more than 50% really do so meaningfully. I have started to think about how I can really enforce my expectations of learning in the classroom, not just say them. I am thinking about tips from Building an Academic Community and how I can set high expectations that center their learning rather than me as a teacher, but act as a teacher to hold them accountable to that learning.
